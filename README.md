I'm Marko, a Software engineer living in <b>London</b> ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§. I work at Onfido where I build dashboards to help businesses verify who their users are safely. I attended the Recurse Center in <b>New York City</b> ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, a self directed retreat for programmers. There I was able to explore how to make programming more accessible and human, played around with some lower-level languages, worked on some generative art projects and paired with lots of great people.

<h3>A couple of projects I've worked on recently:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/markorodic/lines_of_code"><b>Gestural code editor</b></a><br/><i>Prototyped a gestural code editor in the browser.</i></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/markorodic/the-brick-break"><b>Breakout game</b></a><br/><i>Built the same games with different paradigms in JS, profiled the execution time for each game, and created a visualisation showing the differences.</i></li>
